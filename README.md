## Introduction
**Anbima Calendar** is a Python library designed to simplify handling banking holidays specific to Brazil. **ANBIMA (Associa√ß√£o Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais)**, the Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association, plays a crucial role in the development of financial markets in Brazil. This library provides a robust set of tools for determining business days, calculating due dates, and identifying holidays based on the official holiday calendar published by ANBIMA.

The holiday data used in **Anbima Calendar** is sourced directly from ANBIMA's official website: https://www.anbima.com.br/feriados/feriados.asp.
